	abstract = {Sandy beaches are important ecosystems providing coastal protection and recreation, but they face significant threats from human activities and sea level rise. They are inhabited by meiofauna, small benthic invertebrates that are highly abundant and diverse, but are commonly understudied biotic components of beach ecosystems. Here, we investigate the factors shaping meiofaunal metacommunities by employing Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) and Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) to study community turnover and assembly processes. We analysed over 550 meiofauna samples from a {\textgreater}650 km stretch of the southern North Sea coastline using a metabarcoding approach. Our findings reveal that environmental factors, especially Distance from Low Tide and Sediment Grain Size, are important drivers of meiofauna community turnover. This highlights the influence of the gradient from marine to terrestrial habitats and sediment conditions. Spatial factors, which indicate dispersal limitations, also significantly impact community composition, challenging the view that marine meiofauna have broad geographic distributions. The JSDM results show that species sorting by environmental conditions is the dominant process in community assembly with increasing environmental differences between sampling sites, but that biotic associations, or similar environmental preferences, are a major driver of community assembly at sites with similar environmental conditions. Further, we find that spatial factors also significantly influence community assembly across the study region. By facilitating the inference of ecological niches for a high number of meiofaunal taxa, JSDM provides a powerful framework for understanding the ecology of these animals. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental gradients and dispersal limitations in meiofauna and beach ecosystem research, and future research should aim at adding information on functional traits and biotic interactions under varying environmental conditions to understand meiofauna community dynamics and resilience.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}As significant players in material cycling and energy flow, bacteria and eukaryotes play a vital role in the ecosystem. Nevertheless, the community dynamics of bacteria and eukaryotes in rivers and their responses to changes in ecological hydrology have not been studied thoroughly. Based on eDNA technology, this study investigated the bacterial and eukaryotic communities in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Weihe River in different seasons. The seasonal variation and geographical distribution of bacterial and eukaryotic community structures showed significant heterogeneity. The selective theory well explained the response of microbial community assembly to seasonal changes. Deterministic processes dominate microbial community assembly in the middle and lower reaches. The composition and metabolic potential of key functional genes of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}nosZ{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}pqqB{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}pqqD{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}pqqE{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) exhibited strong seasonal patterns and were significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of water. There were significant differences in molecular ecological networks in different periods ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05), with a gradually increasing trend in the complexity of the network from winter to summer. The keystone species (Hub) of the microbial food web in each season included microorganisms ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Malikia{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), algae ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Stephanodiscus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}), and invertebrates ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Polyarthra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}). Structural equation modeling (SEM) results indicated that invertebrate was an important driving factor affecting the changes in community structures. In micro-food webs, both “bottom-up” (resources) and “top-down” (predation) forces strictly controlled the relationship between taxa. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations affected microbial networks, and there was a significant correlation between bacterial and eukaryotic groups and eco-hydrological variables ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we identified the taxon’s change point using threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN), quantitatively revealing the response thresholds of taxa to eco-hydrological changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a novel method of assessing biodiversity wherein samples are taken from the environment via water, sediment or air from which DNA is extracted, and then amplified using general or universal primers in polymerase chain reaction and sequenced using next-generation sequencing to generate thousands to millions of reads. From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era. In this paper, we review the basic methodology, benefits, and concerns of eDNA metabarcoding, and systematically cover the applications of the method in global ecology thus far, including biodiversity monitoring across all habitats and taxonomic groups, ancient ecosystem reconstruction, plant-pollinator interactions, diet analysis, invasive species detection, pollution responses, and air quality monitoring. We also discuss the future applications of the method as well as expected technological advances and how they may impact the way that eDNA metabarcoding may used in the future. eDNA metabarcoding is a unique method still in development and will likely remain in flux for some time as technology advances and procedures become standardized. However, as metabarcoding is optimized and its use becomes more widespread, it is likely to become an essential tool for ecological monitoring and global conservation study.},
